# notes

These are some notes I took for my semester 4 subjects. They concern C programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Data Visualisation

It serves 3 purposes: 
1. It is funny
2. It is perhaps useful if you want to share/look at notes on a different device
3. It actually displays formatted markdown unlike sublime text
